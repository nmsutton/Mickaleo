This project is designed to add at least basic VR to any program on Linux with any VR headset. Eventually it could be a cross platform program to add VR to any program with any headset.

## Deliverables:

1. \*This goal has been already completed\* High performance video streaming to headsets. I have a Durovis Dive 7 headset with Nexus 7 2cnd Gen tablet I stream VR content to. Any remote desktop software is compatible but I recommend Splashtop.  Splashtop is free for personal use and specifically designed for high performance video game level quality streaming. It works but should be used for personal use, if you want to use it professionally, please support them. Please support Splashtop in any situation because it is the best streaming software I have seen compatible with linux, it runs approximately realtime for full 3d software for me.

2.  Viewer mode. Run a window or make a new display output that displays the current OS session and duplicates it for the left and right eye with a divider between them. Have offsets specific and configurable for the headset used, i.e., Durovis Dive. This will be designed to work well with a dual monitor system where one screen can be converted into a VR display and the other a normal display.
	Subgoal: have profiles able to be saved for headsets. Create an online repository where people can share profiles and descriptions of them.

3.  Interaction mode. Track accelerometer movements and have them move the host OS mouse. Create mouse movement in window or new display output of program being streamed which is a different window/program than the one creating the VR split view.

4.  Optional: Create gamepad or VR accessory interactivity with the software running so that mouse and keyboard, etc. do not need to be used.
